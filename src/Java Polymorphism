Polymorphism: one entity in many forms.

1. Static polymorphism: by concept we can implement using "overloading" concept
						this we can do with "constructor and method".

=> constructor overloading: redeclaring the constructor by changing parameters of the constructor in a class

=> method overloading: redeclaring the method by changing parameters of the method in a class.

2. Dynamic polymorphism: by concept called "overriding", this we can do with the method
